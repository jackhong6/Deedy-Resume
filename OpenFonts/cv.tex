% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by

% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%

%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the

\descript{| Summer research student}
\location{May 2017 – August 2017 | Toronto, ON}
Worked with \textbf{\href{http://astro.utoronto.ca/~bovy/}{Professor Jo Bovy}} to develop a Python class to represent the gravitational potential of spiral arms of galaxies in the \textsf{\href{https://github.com/jobovy/galpy}{galpy}} open source Python library. Wrote a comprehensive test suite using \textsf{\href{https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/}{pytest}} to ensure program correctness. Used my software class to investigate the effects of spiral arms on the Oort constants.

\location{May 2016 – August 2016 | Edmonton, AB}
Worked with \textbf{\href{https://sites.google.com/site/temsemeels/marek-malac}{Professor Marek Malak}} to develop and test a micro-controller based on the Intel Galileo Gen 2 Development Board (Arduino) for the Hitachi 3D Tomography Holder used in electron microscopes. Programmed the controller in the Arduino language and MATLAB to work with the existing microscopy software (Maestro). Improved the rotation angle resolution of the tomography holder from 1\degree to 0.25\degree.
